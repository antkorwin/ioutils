== Automatically deleted temp files in Java

There is a standard API to delete a temporary file in java:

[source, java]
----
File temp = File.createTempFile("filename", ".tmp");
temp.deleteOnExit();
----

But this file will be removed only after exit JVM,
if your application actively working with temporary files
then it can lead to the situation when a free space in the temp folder is over,
or sometimes you should restart your application just to clean the temp folder.

To resolve this problem you can use the `TempFile` from `ioutils`:

[source , java]
----
File tmp = TempFile.createEmpty();
----
this file will be deleted after a GC collecting the `tmp` object.

WARNING: Please use the temp file only by this file reference (`tmp` variable in the example above)
if you create a new reference to the temporary file using an absolute path
then you canâ€™t read this file after GC collects the original reference.


Also, we can create non-empty files, creating a file from String:

[source, java]
----
File tmp = TempFile.createFromString("text file context");
----

an InputStream variant:

[source, java]
----
ByteArrayInputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream("file content".getBytes());
File file = TempFile.createFromInputStream(() -> inputStream);
----

And you can set an extension to files (`.tmp` by default):

[source, java]
----
File file = TempFile.createFromString("data file content", "txt");
----


== Read a file from resources in Java

To simplify working with files in the resource folder,
you can use the `ResourceFile` class.
You can read about the main methods in this class below,
or you can see in the unit test here: https://github.com/antkorwin/ioutils/blob/master/src/test/java/com/antkorwin/ioutils/resourcefile/ResourceFileTest.java[ResourceFileTest.java]
where describing all API of this class.

Read a file as String:

[source, java]
----
String content = new ResourceFile("filename_in_resource_folder.txt").readAsString();
----

read as a byte array:

[source, java]
----
byte[] content = new ResourceFile("/test.txt").readAsByteArray();
----

get a file from resource:

[source, java]
----
File file = new ResourceFile("folder/nestedfile").getFile();
----

read an InputStream from a file in resources:

[source, java]
----
try (InputStream inputStream = new ResourceFile("test.txt").getInputStream()) {
    ...
}
----

write a content of file from resources to the OutputStream:

[source, java]
----
ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
new ResourceFile("test.txt").write(() -> outputStream);
----
